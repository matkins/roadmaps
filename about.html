<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>
Roadmaps for Life is a work in progress , a developing work, (as are we) and a drawing together of different strands of our life and work to date.
</p>
<p>
The track <strong>roots</strong> has come out of many years of working in a pastoral capacity and offering prayer ministry to individuals alongside the development of Encounter weekends. Over the years we have consistently accompanied others on a healing journey as they've faced the pain and gaps of their past. 
</p>
<p>
The word accompaniment has come to represent much of who we are and what we love doing. At various points we have had the privilege of walking alongside friends, families, colleagues, creatives and small business leaders. We've been able to listen and share simple observations and reflections that have empowered others to keep walking and find courage to face painful, scary or new challenges. Being drawn to the Monastic tradition we have resonated much with the idea of soul friendship and spiritual accompaniment. In different seasons of life we have sought out and deeply valued the input of elders and mentors. This journey is represented in the track called <strong>trace</strong>.
</p>
<p> 
<strong>Incubate</strong> developed out of a season in Dave's life when he had just come out of difficult job and was in the midst of a fairly major mid- life transition. Catalysed by the abstract loneliness of job hunting he invited other people to share the journey and put out an invite to anyone from our local church that was in a time of transition and wanting to explore future possibilities around work. To his surprise the first time they gathered there were 10 people.  By the end of the process there was a web developer, freelance writer and a metalworker amongst others all joining in. We shared a creative journey together exploring identity, passions and giftings. A year later many of the original incubatees are hatching and about to spread their wings! We've seen positive workplace transitions, a new home-made craft business started and we are about to see a social enterprise start up in Uganda.

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
There's nothing worse than feeling lost and without hope of being found. We believe in a gracious God who is intimately involved in our everyday existence, has created us in a unique and special way and wants to see this unique identity expressed to bring life to His world. In sending his son Jesus He has reached out to find us when we were lost and far from him. His commitment to us is to accompany us through all of life.
</p>
<p>
Despite being raised in great but imperfect families and being part of some great but imperfect churches our own story is that often times we have 'walked with no map' that is had to navigate some major life transitions on our own. We're committed to writing some maps that help others make transitions well and experience life even in the transitions.
</p>
<h3>Future developments</h3>
<p>
Over the coming years we're committed to drawing up some maps to help others navigate life. We're going to pay particular attention to transitions, vocation and a whole life perspective.

<p>
  Dave is planning to take an annual pilgrimage 'Walking the Walk' inviting other men to join him.

<h3>Social aims</h3>
<p>
As the coaching develops we hope to be able to donate a percentage of coaching hours to young people that would value mentoring and otherwise lack the opportunity.
