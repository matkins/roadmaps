<h2>{{page.title}} - The Pilgrimage tapes 2014 Llyn Peninsula</h2>
<h3>Getting my bearings</h3>
<p>
  I want to tell you the story of  a pilgrimage I made in April 2014. Why a pilgrimage? In May of 2014 I turned 40 and I wanted to do something memorable and meaningful to mark the occasion.  Years back I'd imagined I'd go rally driving in the Welsh forest side. As I got closer this rapidly lost its appeal. I discovered Richard Rohr even had a word for this kind of semi-pseudo adventure - 'liminoid' as opposed to liminal. No doubt it would have been fun and exciting but I was looking for something richer and deeper, more lasting. 
  Then the idea of a pilgrimage began to rise in my consciousness. I had watched the film 'The Way' read newspaper articles and been coaching someone who lived in Spain and recently walked the Camino de Santiago himself. Initially this was my intention but sadly the logical challenge of walking the Camino proved a stretch too far and so remains a goal for another day. The idea of a walk, a pilgrimage settled and in the end I walked part of an old pilgrim trail on the Llyn peninsula - an area of outstanding natural beauty which stretches out into the Irish Sea from the north west of Wales.
</p>
<p>
  The basic route involves largely following the Llyn coastal path wending its way down to Aberdaron before catching a ferry to the Bardsey Island where the ruins of the thirteenth century Augustinian abbey of St. Mary's built on earlier Celtic foundation dating back to the sixth century can be found.
</p>
<p>
  One of the books that most profoundly impacted me in the preceding year or so to the pilgrimage was Richard Rohr's 'Falling Upwards'. I'd resonated with this book in a number of ways and adopted some of his language around the idea of 'two halves of life'. I was very much seeing this walk as a hinge point marking my entry into the second half of life and in some respects a different way of living. One of Rohr's insights is that the first half of life is largely determined by what he calls building a 'container for self'. That is in a right way focusing on the development of your character and identity whereas the second half of life is about pouring out your life (the container) for others. Another concept that I'd been mulling on for some time was that of 'liminality'- encapsulating both an edge place and a threshold. I'd first encountered the word in Alan Roxburgh's work 'Missionary congregations'  but also rediscovered it in Rohr's writings as he looked through the lens of male initiation rites of indigenous peoples. In fact I'd also considered attending one of Rohr's MROP (male rites of passage) in Scotland later in the summer but additional time away from home and family proved a limiting factor. In hindsight I think I discovered a version of my own.
</p>
<p>
  In the Llyn I had a liminal place and as a nearly forty year old man I stood at a threshold. As the idea of a walk settled I began to plan both spiritually and practically for the trip hoping to shape it as a rite of passage.
</p>
<p>
  The Llyn is somewhere I've visited often having borrowed a friend's family cottage many times over the years. In fact I'd nearly taken part of the same walk accompanying a friend on Sabbatical the previous year but this time the fairly imminent arrival of my friend's baby had prevented the trip. The Llyn ticked many boxes. It was near enough but far enough away. It was known in part but with still plenty to explore. I knew from experience that it was also stunningly beautiful, coastal and within reasonably reach of Sheffield and Bristol where the majority of my companions would be travelling from. Having said that travel was a challenge made somewhat harder by the recent storms and flooding that had wiped away part of the Cambrian coast railway line between Barmouth and Pwllheli. 
</p>

<h3>The plan</h3>
<p>
  I initially invited my Dad, brother and significant male friends who I had journeyed with in life. I also later widened the invite to younger men that were part of my church community.
</p>
<p>
  I was to take the walk over four days leaving Sheffield at tea-time on Tuesday and making my way down to Aberdaron by Friday before catching the boat to Bardsey on the Saturday, returning to Sheffield later that night.  That left three day-long walks of between 10-14 miles. I would stay at B&B's along the route and people would come out when time allowed and join me at various stages along the way.
</p>
<p>
  As the trip took shape in my head I decided that I wanted to walk with questions that I would chew over with whoever was accompanying me on a given day and began making a mental note of key questions. I also liked the idea of dividing up the walk over five days so that it represented five stages of my life. On day 1 I would reflect back on being aged 0-8, day 2 aged 8-16 and so on. I also wanted the walk to be challenging so I'd carry my belongings in a rucksack over the course of the walk.
</p>
<p>
  As it happened many of my Sheffield-based friends couldn't come and neither could my brother who was working overseas.  I would be accompanied by my Dad on the first day and then Phil, Neil & Matthew and Fran would make up the supporting cast for the adventure driving out to join me for different legs of the journey. Despite lots of last minute reshuffling I would have someone to accompany me on each day of the walk.
</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>
  I left Sheffield at tea time on Tuesday 22nd of April catching a tram to Sheffield train station where I would catch a train to Pwllheli which in fact would only take me as far as Barmouth due to the aforementioned storm damage. My Dad had brought his Caravan and had pitched up in Criccieth at a friend's house. To save an epic replacement bus journey that would have got me to Pwllheli at midnight my Dad met me an a hour and a half earlier at Barmouth and we stayed the night in his caravan.
</p>
<p>
  I find train journey's strange especially when I'm alone. I suppose they're liminal in their own way as you travel between towns or cities, life blurring by outside and a small cell of a seat to sit in read, reflect, think. The stand-out thought was a surprising one. I half-wondered whether my brother would be there to meet me (even though I knew he was overseas and unable to make the trip). It was the kind of thing my brother would do but I think deep down reflected a longing for brotherhood. While he has been overseas for 7 years there's been a chunk of life we've not been able to share and I think something of the emotion and sadness of that rose up in me on that train journey. It was only a couple of months later that he would announce that he had his family were returning to the UK after all and so in some ways this longing, heart prayer got answered. One of the overwhelming prayers of thankfulness of the trip was for the brothers that God had given me throughout life to walk with.
</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>
  After a patchy night sleep we dressed, breakfasted and put on our waterproofs. The Welsh weather could not wait to inflict it's drizzle upon us. We drove to Clyynog Fawr where it is said that medieval  pilgrims would have gathered at the door of St Beuno's Church to pray before making their trip.
</p>
<div class='row'><div class='col-md-8 col-md-offset-2'><div class='thumbnail'><img src='/img/blog-3.jpg' class='img-responsive'><div class='caption'><p class='text-center'>Sundial in St. Beuno's churchyard</p></div></div></div></div>
<p>
  We found the church open and stepped in to explore discovering a number of interesting artefacts including an ancient wooden chest hollowed out of a single piece of ash (Cyff Beuno), and used to keep alms donated by the pilgrims and Beuno's Stone (Maen Beuno)- a large shield like slab of rock with a carved cross etched upon it.
</p>
<p>
  We prayed a simple prayer deciding that we would pray at ancient spiritual sites we encountered along the way and ventured into the churchyard in pursuit of a sundial dated between the late 10th century and the early 12th century informing the monks who used it as to when to pray and when to work
</p>
<p>
  This first days walk would take us from Clyynog Fawr to Morfa Nefyn. We left the church and picked up the pilgrim trail. I'd logged several questions for my Dad that day mindful that he more than most would hold clues to my childhood as I reflected on the early years. I specifically wanted to ask him whether he remembered the day of my birth, what I was like as a kid and where my name came from.
</p>
<p>
  Having left the church we took a short detour to seek out the first of many wells along the route - 'Beuno's well' again praying this time for our health and old injuries as we walked. The first part of the route follows the somewhat uninspiring A499 but it was a pleasant sight to see the small pilgrims route way marking signs on wooden posts as we made our way.
</p>
<div class='row'><div class='col-md-8 col-md-offset-2'><div class='thumbnail'><img src='/img/blog-4.jpg' class='img-responsive'><div class='caption'><p class='text-center'>St Beuno's well</p></div></div></div></div>
<p>
  It wasn't long before I could feel the weight of my rucksack and the shoulder straps beginning to cut into the flesh of my shoulders. I gained hope as we headed for Trefor the village of the holiday cottage which held fond memories. It is on the approach to Trefor that you become most aware of Yr Eifl a mountain of three peaks and the site of a granite quarry that towers over the village. I was aware of the mountain from previous visits but had never climbed it. Today was the day.
</p>
<p>
  We were probably half way through our ascent when we faced our first obstacle my Dad was struggling with the steep ascent and having already had a heart bypass I was mindful of his condition.  My newly purchased waterproofs were sadly not living up to their name. The weather had definitely livened up as it has a habit of doing when you climb a mountain. Mild drizzle at the bottom can be torrential wind-driven rain at the top. Visibility had dropped to less than 10m and the reality of the manifold mountain tracks corresponded less and less to the nicely drawn out lines of the OS map. Holding the map I thought I knew where we needed to go but was also weighing up both weather and our physical condition. I felt responsible for Dad as we wavered for a while on the mountain before deciding to take a path to a ridge before making a decision.
</p>
<p>
  I know chatting with Dad afterwards that we both had serious doubts and internal questions in our heads about the wisdom of carrying on. I think it was not knowing what we would face had caused us to consider turning round and heading back down the mountain. To be honest the conditions and our quandary felt oppressive. Made worse by a chilling voice goading me in my thoughts 'Are you turning back pilgrim?'
</p>
<p>
  We pressed on to the ridge top reaching the full height of our climb where we picked up a gravel working vehicle track that descended from the quarry workings and led us down off the mountain. The relief was almost palpable. What followed as an incredibly steep descent to Nant Gwrtheyrn a welsh language and heritage centre. We alighted here for lunch and supplemented our home-made sandwiches with freshly made scones and cups of tea from the cafe that we had bundled into in our soggy state.
</p>
<p>
  Somewhere along the way near Trefor we'd chatted about the questions I was carrying. I'd heard Dad speak with real affection about Mum and the maternity dress she had made when she was expecting me. The most cryptic and intriguing answer concerned my name. Dad was clear that Mum had chosen David and that he had chosen Peter (my middle name). His father had wanted to name him Peter but was overruled and so my Dad took his Father's first name as a middle name instead.
</p>
<p>
  I've often reflected on the meaning of my names and the sense of identity that they convey - both David as 'beloved' and Peter as 'rock'. They feel apt and describe much of who I am and who I am called to become. I've reflected since whether I've lived the first half as a 'David' and that something of the identity of Peter is to be more fully lived out in the second half of my life.
</p>
<p>
  The rest of the day was a slog as blisters formed, muscles ached and we slowly edged ever nearer to our refuge and B&B at Morfa Nefyn.
</p>
<p>
  Another short stopping off point was the church of St Beuno's in Pistyll. This tiny, ancient church hosts a 12th Century font and the remains of a medieval wall painting. Parishioners have revived the tradition of celebrating Lammas (marking the harvest of wheat), and we were treated to the sight of rushes on the church floor marking this tradition.
</p>
<p>
  As we arrived exhausted at Llys Olwen we were greeted by the proprietor Ann. I had little energy or desire for small talk and the first thing I did was go to bed and rest.  I got up sometime later and showered before hitting the road again this time to find an evening meal at the Cliffs inn, Nefyn.
</p>
<p>
  We returned after our supper heading for our beds desperate to get some rest and sleep. Try as I might and did I could simply not sleep.
</p>
<hr>


<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>
  It was either 2am or 4am when I finally knocked on my dad's door in the room next door. I was feeling pretty rough and anxious by this time wondering what I'd done to myself physically. I was concerned I was dehydrated, hypothermic you name it! In my exhausted and now sleep deprived state I was even considering whether or not my drink had been spiked at the pub. Dad was awake too; he could not sleep either and as he righted himself and sat up he began to wretch. I rang NHS direct desperate for someone to reassure us that we were ok. The kind nurse went through the now infamous long list of questions steadily ruling things out and providing much appreciated reassurance before asking 'whether I'd felt like this before?' The closest comparable feeling was after running a half marathon and then she asked 'Do you think your just exhausted?' to which I replied a desperate, relieved, emphatic 'yes'.
</p>
<p>
  Returning to bed I think I grabbed a couple of hours sleep before texting Phil conscious that he was about to rise early and set off from Sheffield . the ext said that I was exhausted and was going to effectively call off the trip. I'd also aggravated an historic knee injury and earlier in the day I had requested Phil bring out a knee brace.
</p>
<p>
  My plight and desperation had only spurred Phil into action. He left Sheffield drove to Wales, sat outside the shops waiting for them to open to purchase a knee brace then drove to the B&B arriving at 10am.
</p>
<p>
  When I awoke I knocked on my dad's door and he'd gone - his plan being to catch a bus back to Clynnog to pick up his car that we'd left there the previous day. I assumed he'd left me sleeping not wanting to deprive me of sleep and had simply made his way not being able to say goodbye. I sat down on my bed still feeling fragile and felt an overwhelming sadness, like I'd lost my dad. Then I heard voices. He was of course downstairs with Phil chatting with the landlady as Phil enjoyed his homemade Belgian bun and struggled to decide which of the seven homemade jams on offer would be a suitable accompaniment.
</p>
<p>
  I managed some food and then we said goodbye to my dad who'd completed his leg of the journey and Phil and I made plans to make today a recovery and rest-day by drastically cutting short the planned walk. We chose instead to head for a nearby town and walk to a beach from there.
</p>
<p>
  It was as we drove along the B4417 towards Tudweillog that I began to relay the events of the previous day. My overwhelming feeling was that it had been hard, really hard and perhaps the hardest part had been that the only voice that I'd heard that day was the voice of the enemy. In my wrecked physical and now emotional state it was here that the tears came and God broke in. We stopped as Phil pulled into a lay-by facing a green hill on the outskirts of Edern.
</p>
<p>
  The second day's walking represented the years 8-16 my childhood and early adolescence. A season that held a sense of grief and loss. Hence in hindsight the tears. A phrase had been tumbling around my mind, another Rohrism, 'the fire of adolescence'. I think meaning that adolescence is a time of passion and those passions being tempered. I felt I'd been burned by the fire rather than tempered. But my primary grief was that I felt that I'd had to navigate the journey into manhood mostly on my own. There'd been 'no map to follow' and this had been a felt and real loss.
</p>
<p>
  Phil was like Jesus to me that day - one closer than a brother. He listened and gently questioned, read scripture to and over me largely from the Psalms 61-63 as I spluttered out my 'losses' - not getting ordained, not marrying my first love, not having a map to follow and he prayed for me.
</p>
<p>
  The life of Peter and the second half language around his future in John 21 came to mind. After Peter's reinstatement Jesus tells him that when he was younger he dressed himself and went where he wanted; but when he is old he will stretch out his hands, and someone else will dress him and lead him where he does not want to go. Jesus we're told is speaking of Peter's death. The words spoke to me of being free to let other people 'dress me' with their words or opinions and not let it define who I am and knowing the freedom of being free enough to be led by others. I decided to let Phil lead me that day. I'd follow him let him make the decisions and shape the course of the day.
</p>
<p>
  We set off for Tudweillog and having parked up we enjoyed a drink out in the sunshine in the garden of the Lion Hotel in tudweillog.
</p>
<p>
  After that we joined the footpath heading for the beach (porth Towyn).  We traversed several  fields and skirted a few farms before discovering an idyllic secret campsite hidden on the cliff side. Porth Towyn emerged as we rounded a bend. This stunning, sparsely populated beach was the ideal place to sit and eat our ham sandwiches generously made and filled by Ann our landlady. We walked along the sea shore and enjoyed feeling the freedom of sand and sea beneath our feet.
</p>
<p>
  We both gave each other space knowing in some ways this was a wonderful combination of childhood revisited and worship as we enjoyed nature's simple pleasures.
</p>
<p>
  I was happy to be led by Phil, content to go with the flow (except through the field of cows. (neither a happy childhood nor adult memory.)
</p>
<p>
  After we'd had time to be and enjoy creation's finest we made our way back taking a slightly different route but still emerging at the pub where we started out. We popped across the road to visit St Cwyfan's church alighting in the porch enjoying its shade and the wood and iron of door and lock. Before leaving we called into the Post Office for Ice creams and to pick up postcards to send home.
</p>
<p>
  It was late afternoon when we set off for our next B&B at Carrog Farm where we'd be under the care and attention of Mrs Thomas. After one short and unintentional detour we arrived to be welcomed by a Welsh speaking farmer. A slight miscommunication  had meant that our landlady had gone to the trouble of cooking us a home-made meal. We sat in an expansive conservatory with a stunning panoramic view of the Welsh countryside and tucked into our tea which involved the choice of two puddings which in effect meant one each!
</p>
<p>
  After which we retired to the lounge and sprawled out over the two settees getting chance to process life and for me to hear more of Phil's story.
</p>
<p>
  I retired early fully intending to catch up on sleep while Phil waited up for Matthew & Neil who were driving up from Bristol after work to join us. Having made the journey myself when resident in Bristol I knew it was a long slow diagonal cross-country drive largely on A roads. I remember hearing their arrival and welcome, thinking briefly of getting up before drifting back off to deep sleep.
</p>

<h3>Day 4</h3>
Over a hearty breakfast the four of us caught up the next morning, Phil having relayed much of the previous days antics to our new companions. After another consultation of the OS map we decided to drive ahead to that night's B&B in Aberdaron, leave a car, all pile into one and head over to Whistling sands car park from where we would start our walk to Aberdaron. Whistling Sands was a beach that had proved elusive and somewhat mysterious despite many trips to the peninsula. Sadly the walk gave us the briefest of glimpses before it was gone and behind us as we picked up the coastal path again.</p><p>I was particularly looking forward to this leg of the walk for a number of reasons. It was also a stretch of coast I had not seen or explored. I'd also been mulling over the idea of getting baptised as part of the rite. I'd never been baptised by full immersion, despite a few near misses during my teenage years. The idea of 'baptising' the first half of my life and rising up into the second appealed to me. I knew that this stretch of the coast held St. Mary's well a small rectangular cleft in the rock face filled with fresh water. </p><p>The coastal path took us round and up a number of good-sized hills peaking at several impressive viewpoints- one an old lifeguard station atop of  Mynydd Mawr hill. Here we posed for photos, Bardsey in view behind us. I enjoyed this stretch catching up with Neil & Matthew, seeing each of us rotate as we walked, sharing stories, listening, enjoying the walk and all we were experiencing.</p>
<div class='row'><div class='col-md-8 col-md-offset-2'><div class='thumbnail'><img src='/img/blog-1.jpg' class='img-responsive'><div class='caption'><p class='text-center'>Bardsey in the distance</p></div></div></div></div><p>It was a beautiful day the sun shining and as we wound our way around the coast we saw the occasional sign for St. Mary's well and its Welsh name counterpart 'Ffynnon Fair' but somehow we overshot it. In another of those 'do we don't we?' moments we had to decide whether or not to head back and try and find it or press on towards our destination. Eventually we settled on two search parties tracking back to try and locate it. Matthew & Phil found some stone steps leading down to the cliff face and seeing their descent Neil & I were in quick pursuit. The guide books had cautioned us that at high tide the pool can easily be filled with waves splashing up over it so the four of us quickly scrambled down to it. A thin green lined sliver of a pool just short of a couple of metres long and measuring no more than half a metre at its widest could clearly be seen now we knew what we were looking for. Upon my arrival I promptly announced that I was getting baptized and began shedding clothes. Phil was nearly undressed before I was. We stopped at trunks for decency's sake (there were a few other walkers but not many) though part of me was keen for total nakedness. I gave an impromptu speech sharing something of my own faith journey, battles and the things that I was thankful for in the first half of life. Then Phil & I climbed in to what was a surprisingly deep pool - cold but not freezing. On confession of my faith Phil baptized me - I think after a few go's I got most of myself under the water.</p>
<div class='row'><div class='col-md-8 col-md-offset-2'><div class='thumbnail'><img src='/img/blog-2.jpg' class='img-responsive'><div class='caption'><p class='text-center'>St. Mary's Pool</p></div></div></div></div><p>It was one of the most exhilarating things that I've ever done, the combination of spontaneity, meaning and adventure coming together in a rite worthy of marking my forty years.</p><p>Grabbing a towel I sat on a rock and the three guys prayed for me recording their prayers on a phone. I've since transcribed this recording so I have a copy of my Baptismal prayer which drew much from the imagery and scenery in which we found ourselves. I dried, dressed and we set off again with a stride in our step, I think each knowing we had shared in and been part of something.</p><p></p><p>As we retraced our path to the spot we had earlier turned back from Phil asked me what I hoped for in the second half of life specifically in the next 10 years. I replied in no particular order a deepening of my marriage, to see my girls raised into womanhood (my eldest would be 20), a group of young men to raise into leadership, a patch of land to work and men to keep walking with.</p><p>After this It seemed as we walked that my own questions became those that others were carrying or the questions I was asking of others. Neil was processing the reality of walking with people currently unable to have kids and his brave reengagement with the process of ordination into the C of E. For a long time I've walked with Matthew accompanying him in what I know at some time will mean his living and serving abroad.</p>
<p>Buoyed by sights of a chough (my first) we descended from a ridge to a small cove with a slipway Porth Meudwy from which the ferry to Bardsey departs. The old tractor and various pieces of marine paraphernalia gave away its occupation. We met an older man on the water's edge looking out to sea. Wondering whether he was Colin the Skipper I ventured that I was hoping to make the crossing tomorrow to be informed that this would be unlikely due to high winds forecast for the following day. This was hard to take on a stunningly warm, still and sunny day looking out at the calmest of seas. The short Bardsey sound crossing is notoriously dangerous and so no chances are taken with as many as one in four crossings cancelled. I was told to ring Colin later that night for a final confirmation of the decision.</p>
<p>Aberdaron was within sight now and we finally sauntered into the small town heading for one of the two pubs, choosing the Ty Newydd Hotel  with a terrace looking out to sea.
</p>
<p>
  Celebratory beers were purchased. A local photographer was displaying stunning prints of the area capturing much of what we had just seen and experienced over the course of the day's walk. When it came to leaving the pub in search of food it took quite a while. One of our party had temporarily disappeared. It turned out later that I was being kept out of the way while one of them bought one of the photos - which would be later given as a gift at a birthday celebration with friends and family back at home. 
</p>
<p>
  Our legs carried us to a smart newly refurbished chip shop complete with aquarium Sblash Caban Pysgod. The four of us perched on the picnic benches overlooking the Daron river drinking in the last of the evening sun, each other's company and hungrily devouring our fish and chips. It felt like a good end to a good day. 
</p>
<p>
  A short walk up the hill out of the town took us back to the B&B at no. 2 Dolfor. I said my thank yous and goodbyes to Phil, Matt & Neil as they set off to retrieve Phil's car and head back to Sheffield and Bristol respectively. I was alone for the first time on the trip, grateful for company, everyone's efforts to be there and the celebration that we had shared in walking together that day.
</p>
<p>
  I had a couple of hours before I would hook up with Fran and his expectant wife Jen as they drove through Wales to meet me. There was only one thing for it. A bath!</p>
<p>
  Fran fitted well to accompany me on the last leg of the journey being a relatively new friend that God had brought into my life in the last year. I had met his lovely wife Jen over 10 years ago but overseas travel and living on their part meant he remained a name and Jen's husband until a mutual friend had recently reconnected us.
</p>
<p>
  We had arranged to rendezvous at the other pub in the village (The Ship Inn). Fran called while I was in the bath and after I'd dressed I wondered back down the hill to join them. They had already ordered and were eventually able to tuck into a delicious looking (and tasting I was reliably informed) hearty pub-sized platefuls of food.
</p>
<p>
  After a good chat and some more relaying of the journey so far we set off to confuse our landlady as a heavily pregnant woman waved goodnight to her husband to spend a night camping further up the hillside while Fran & I sheepishly retired to our twin room, Before you ask it was Jen's idea and one she seemed very happy with.
</p>
<p>
  I'd found out earlier that night that the trip to Bardsey had indeed been cancelled, Colin's skipperly voice on his mobile answering machine had reliably informed that the trip was indeed off because of the high winds that were expected the following day.
</p>
<hr>



<h3>Day 5</h3>
<p>
The following morning after another resplendent cooked breakfast and some map work we met up with Jen who ferried us down to the National Trust car park and newly built visitor's centre in Aberdaron where we parked up ready to tackle the day's walk.
</p>
<p>
Fran was happy to see the stretch of coast line that I had first encountered yesterday, assured of sea views and the elusive Bardsey Island beyond. We arranged to meet Jen at the campsite for lunch. To me at least with just the two of us walking it was a day of listening and speaking as we took steps to get to know each other more. There were events in Fran's back-story that I knew of but not about - particularly a near-miss parachuting accident out in New Zealand. We talked about creativity and fatherhood amongst other things. From our hillside viewpoint we could see the white riders out at sea evidencing the increase in wind speed and justifying the boat trip cancellation. We could feel the wind too noticing the extra effort required to walk into a stiff breeze.
</p>
<p>
Fran represented new friendships that I hoped would be formed and enjoyed in the second half of life. Despite wanting to be as cut off as possible from home it had been unavoidable especially regarding the small matter of how I was to get home. My lovely wife had been negotiating on my half with Kris a friend round who lives round the corner. Returning by coach or train was nigh impossible unless I fancied an overnight wait somewhere along the route. Kris gave up a valuable Saturday (having the demands of his own business and family) to drive the  3 1/2 hour journey to Wales to the Pwllheli Asda car park, pick me up and drive the 3 1/2 hour journey back.
</p>
<p>
Jen & Fran dropped me off intending to extend their stay with an extra nights camping together this time.
Despite both Kris & I both being deep introverts it was a good journey. I had a complete journey to share and reflect on and this sparked memories for Kris from his not quite forty years of living. Despite the obviously tiring double journey we were both in good spirits. To me Kris signified again a second half man - willing to drive a long way and back on one day for someone else. I felt blessed, honoured and satisfied that the pilgrimage was complete. Bardsey had remained out of reach but I felt gave opportunity at a later date for the walk to be revisited.
</p>
<p>
I returned home deeply grateful, changed, celebrated and ready for the challenge of the next 40 years of pilgrimage. I was thankful for God's work in my life, the family he has blessed me with and the company of brothers.
</p>
