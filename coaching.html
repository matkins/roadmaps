<h3>Route</h3>
<p>
  We've found that offering people a choice of options helps begin a conversation and shape the coaching process. 
  To this end we offer 3 tracks.
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Roots - An opportunity to revisit the past through healing prayer.  A process of acknowledging pain and hurts (often encountered in  childhood and adolescence) that can have a negative impact on our sense of self and the flourishing of our unique identity and vocation.
      <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Trace - An opportunity to discern together where God's Spirit is at work in your life at present paying particular attention to dreams, desires and your relationships.
      <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Incubate - An opportunity to take a creative journey and explore future vocational pathways.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  In reality the coaching sessions usually draw on at least a couple of these tracks.
</p>
<h3>Setting off</h3>
<p>
  Before we start working with a client we offer a free 45min consultation to give both parties chance to meet, share something of their stories and decide whether they would like to work together.
</p>
<p>
In this session it is usual to explore The Lifemap based on the work of Robert Clinton to help provide a framework for a whole life journey and to plot where an individual might be at present. In addition we will seek to decide which of the tracks or combination of tracks seems most appropriate.
</p>
<p>
A typical session would involve a client sharing key events and reflections since the last session and feeding back on any action steps taken or exercises completed. The coach will normally have a number of questions to help direct the conversation and occasionally reflections to share. The end of the session will usually be a recap of emerging themes and signposts towards areas that the client might like to explore before the next session.
</p>
<p>
It is usual for the coaching sessions (lasting 1 hour) to take place every 4-6 weeks giving time for reflection and action in between sessions.
</p>
<p>
Ideally meetings would take place face-to-face but the option of coaching via Skype is also available.
</p>

<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>
The rate for an hourly session is Â£40. If a series of 4-6 sessions is purchased in advance then a 10% discount is applied.
</p>
<p>
If cost is prohibitive then we are open to an initial conversation about creative ways to overcome this hurdle (though we would expect everyone to contribute at least something financially). Anyone can donate at any time to our work.
</p>
<p>
Fees can be paid by bank transfer or cheque. Details will be provided at the end of Session 1.
