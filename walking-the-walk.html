title: Walking the walk

<h2>{{page.title}}</h2>
<p>
For his 40th birthday David undertook a pilgrimage to mark the occasion walking a stretch of the Pilgrim Way on the Llyn peninsula in North Wales. David walked part of the journey with his Dad and the rest with significant male friends that have come to be part of his life and journey so far. In total 5 men joined him. The trip proved to be an awakening. (David was baptised in a rock pool!), a rite of passage and a great thing to do. This spawned the idea of 'walking the walk'. Each year David is proposing to take a pilgrimage, inviting other men to join him and making it in some way a rite of passage. The idea is simple to make the walk meaningful, memorable and challenging. David found the idea of 'walking with questions' helped him and the other men engage with their time.

If this inspires you to do likewise - to gather a bunch of men, plan a pilgrimage and make it a rite of passage then we love to hear from you. It would be great to gather stories and photos of other men 'walking the walk'. if you've got a story worth sharing contact <a href="mailto:dave@roadmapsforlife.co.uk">dave@roadmapsforlife.co.uk</a>.
